### "All these worlds are yours, except Europa. Attempt no landing there. Use them together. Use them in peace."



## Author's Notes:

These graphic resources are for the MSX developer community and the retro scene.

You can use them where you need it or to create new graphics.

They have been made using the Inkscape software. https://inkscape.org/
